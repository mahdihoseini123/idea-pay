# Building a partnership pool

In addition to lowering the transfer costs between A and B

In the future, it will be useful to build partnership pools for NFT purchases that cost, for example, one million dollars.

For example, you want to buy an NFT worth one million dollars

You have 50% of the capital and you predict that the price of this NFT will go up

You need a partner to buy to liquidate money in a pool for a certain period of time

Well, for this, we write the rules before creating the pool

 For example, someone who has more than 50% of the tokens in the pool is allowed to sell NFT alone
or not

Or you can withdraw only 1% of your deposit

Or how long this pool will hold your money

And after the sale of NFT, how many percent of the profit will reach you

What do we do with this pool if the NFT does not make a profit?

How many percent interest is guaranteed from another pool

And voting with DAO equals based on the number of people or based on the amount of coins in the pool



# payment confirmation

 Having a phone number or email

Or use the Telegram bot to pay

If there is no payment address or it is incomplete, you enter your email or phone number to completely draft the deposit address.

Also, use the two-step password of Google Authenticator

We increase security with these works

Also, for high amounts, for example, 1 million dollars, deposit in such a way that first, for example, a small and special number, for example, 105.5455

sent and then confirmed until the full amount is sent
